Approcah 
1. first we declare and intialize a counter variable with 0 and an element variable.
2.iterate the array through for loop and check the conditions :-
   if (cnt == 0) {
            cnt = 1;
            el = v[i];
        }
        else if (el == v[i]) cnt++;
        else cnt--;

3. Now check if the sorted element is the majority elment. so we initialize the counter again with zero value and iterate the array for check the condition 
  if(arr[i] == ele) increment the counter by one.

4 at the last chek :-
 if (cnt1 > (n / 2)) return el;
    return -1;  

Time Complexity : O(N)+O(N) for iterate using for loop 2times
Space Complexity : O(1) Because we didn't use any extyra space
