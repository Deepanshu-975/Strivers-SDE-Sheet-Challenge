Optimized solution :
1. create a dummy node points towards the dummy of next and create two pointer fast and slow.
2.iterate a loop till the and and move the fast pointer .
3. iteate another loop while fast !=Null move a slow and fast pointer ahead one step.
then it reaches the node which were delete so move solw pointer next to next.
4. return the dummy-netx;
