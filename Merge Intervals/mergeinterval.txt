1. sort the intervals.
2. then create a 2d vector and iterate through the loop and check the conditions 
 if (merged.empty() || merged.back()[1] < intervals[i][0]) then push it into a vextor v 
 and push the v in merge array
3.else find the max in the intervals elemnts.
4. return the merge array.
